# ResistPipe
ResistPipe is a Java-based command-line bioinformatics tool that screens an unknown DNA sequence for known antibiotic resistance genes using reference-based sequence matching. The program accepts FASTA inputs, reports detected resistance genes, and provides both textual and visual (ASCII bar chart) summaries of match strength.
